# Lesson 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a method where a computer learns patterns from data
and uses those patterns to make predictions or decisions.

Instead of writing fixed rules, we provide examples,
and the machine learns from them.

## Why Do We Use Machine Learning?

We use machine learning when:
- relationships between variables are complex
- traditional methods are not sufficient
- prediction accuracy is important
- large amounts of data are available

---

## Examples in Research

Machine learning is commonly used in:
- travel behavior analysis
- adoption and choice modeling
- traffic prediction
- safety and risk analysis

## Important Message for Students

Machine learning is a **tool**, not a replacement for thinking.
Researchers must always interpret and validate results.
