# Lesson 2: Understanding Data for Machine Learning

## What Is Data?

In machine learning, data is a collection of observations.
Each observation represents one case, such as one person,
one trip, or one event.

---

## Rows and Columns

- Each **row** represents one observation
- Each **column** represents one variable

Machine learning learns patterns from columns to predict outcomes.

---

## Features and Target

- **Features (X):** input variables used for prediction
- **Target (Y):** variable we want to predict

Example:
- Features: age, income, travel cost
- Target: adoption decision

## Why Data Quality Matters

Machine learning models depend entirely on data quality.
Poor data leads to poor predictions, regardless of the algorithm used.

## Important Message for Students

Always understand your data before applying any machine learning model.
